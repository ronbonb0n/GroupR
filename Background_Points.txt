Prologue Start scene (before anything has happened)
"Well, I drew the short straw, guess it was just my time to be kicked from the party and figure a way out of this place, clear the dungeons and get the keys – a trap to be sure, but I don’t have much choice – Never let it said that Ferŷnier was a quitter"
SKIP – Move straight into ortho world
Or CONTINUE with Prologue:
1.
“This used to be the hub – a player exclusive area, somewhere you could meet and chat with your friends and jump into a dungeon… it’s a lot smaller now. Only a few dungeons left, and they’re a lot more dangerous than they used to be.”
2.
“Either way, I should be safe here, although safe is relative I suppose. I believe there was some kind of shop around here, might be dangerous but that little bot always seemed friendly, you never know might be worth checking in on.”
3. 
"I think they said the first dungeon was up here to the left... Well here goes nothing"
If the player visits the vendor before a dungeon
Dialogue from vend-bot
1.
Hi there! Wow are you another player? Haven’t seen one of you in a while, I’ve seen a few come and go in the past some came back a few times, others I only got to see once.
2.
Don’t worry I won’t hurt you, not sure why but I want to help you. One of others said he had to clear the dungeons to get out. Why would he want to get out?
3.
Anyway, if you come back make sure to bring me some bits and pieces – I’m good at recycling and can make you some useful tools to play with!
