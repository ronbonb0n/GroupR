## World map design proceduralism
**_Note_: World map isn't procedurally generated within game, instead this proceduralism is an experimentation with tools that can speed up level development.**<br/>
The tiles that make up the map are generated by and image - each pixel represents the tile.<br/>
Currently the generator can support up to 10 different tile types and changes to the code base can be implemented to expand this.<br/>
Tile rotation is not yet implemented - can be done if RGB values are used, instead of just luminosity.<br/>
The generator image is found in the root/Assets/ directory.<br/>
For some reason only jpeg seemed to work. This might be due to encoding methods JPEG encodes per pixel, whilst PNG encodes for each scan-line of pixel.<br/>
The generator script runs within the engine editor for ease of use.<br/>
####The pixel values currently used are tabulated below
Tile Type | Hex Code(#) | Decimal
--- | --- | ---
Grass | FFFFFF | 1.0
Deep Grass | E6E6E6 | 0.9
Dying Grass | CCCCCC | 0.8
Dead Space | B2B2B2 | 0.7
Bridge | 999999 | 0.6
Coast | 808080 | 0.5
Water | 000000 ! 0.0
Sci-Fi Bridge | 666666 | 0.4
_Currently the Coast block is not being used and may be dropped_<br/>
_Water block technically represents a lack of a block for render efficiency as we can represent the water with just a single plain_<br/>
**Updates to the generator will be placed in the table when neccassary**<br/>
To use the tool:<br/>
1. Open image in any image editting software - I prefer Krita it's free and fairly powerful
2. Adjust image with a solid square brush - Krita has a pixel art brush which is ideal
..* Use colours tabulated above to correspond with desired tiles
3. Export the output overwriting past image - or export new output but make sure to encode it properly with JPEG max quality
..* If you export a new image when in Unity:
....* Enable read/write in image properties
....* Set format to RGBA32
....* Set non power of 2 to None
4. Within the world map scene there is already an object called world builder that contains the builder script
..* Make sure the correct prefabs are assigned
..* Make sure the correct world generator texture is assigned
5. It is recommenended that you delete the game object called **Parent** that holds all of the tiles within it's heirarchy
6. Go back to your world builder GameObject and click the execute boolean button - Your updated world will be built
