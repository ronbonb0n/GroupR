# Sounds:

Almost all of the sounds we have used in the game were created specifically for it, either using an online tool [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/) or by recording them with a microphone and editing them afterward. Huge efforts were made to produce each and every sound for the game; however, due to a lack of resources, expertise, and equipment to create our own original audio files, some couldn't be produced from scratch.

Using an open-source website that offers sounds that can be used in projects [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), some sounds were used to get inspiration. Based on those sounds, new audio files were produced, edited, and passed through pitch and amplitude shifters, de-noisers, exponential fades, and other filters to make them suitable for the game:

- Drones' rotors: Eelke's sound was modified (available at https://freesound.org/people/Eelke/sounds/198235/) and used it in the game.
- Background ambience of a level: Edited the sound provided by Flamiffer (available at https://freesound.org/people/Flamiffer/sounds/530161) and used it in the game.
- The sound of the Decoy: Tweaked Breviceps' sound (available at https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/493162) and used it in the game.
