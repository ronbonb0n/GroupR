# Sounds:

Almost all of the sounds we have used in our game were created specifically for it, either using an online tool [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/) or by recording them with a microphone and editing them afterward. We made an effort to make every sound for our game ourselves; however, due to a lack of resources and expertise, some couldn't be produced.

Using sounds from an open-source website that offers us sounds we may use for our projects [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), we used sounds from this website to get inspiration. Based on those sounds, we produced our own new audio files, edited them, and added pitch and amplitude shifters, de-noisers, exponential fades, and other filters to make them suitable for our game:

- Drones' rotors: We modified Eelke's sound (available at https://freesound.org/people/Eelke/sounds/198235/) and used it in the game.
- Background ambience of a level: We edited the sound provided by Flamiffer (available at https://freesound.org/people/Flamiffer/sounds/530161) and used it in the game.
- The sound of the Decoy: We modified Breviceps' sound (available at https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/493162) and used it in the game.
